4chanscraper
------------

4chanscraper is an extensible, well-written, and (hopefully) easy to use
scraper and optionally browser for the 4chan imageboard.

It features:
* Automatic scraping of all boards on 4chan.
* A easy-to-use database creator to simplify the process of beginning to scrape.
* A simple GUI which also includes thread-view and fullview modes.

It is designed to simplify the process of /rar/ing individual threads, and even
supports creating an archive from a thread once it has been fully downloaded.

4chanscraper was written with the bandwidth and HDD space -concious in mind, and
as such gives you the option to only download the images from the threads
you choose, and to perform metadata-only scrapes.

In addition to scraping images, 4chanscraper will also save the associated text
which was posted along with the image, and this is all saved in an easily browsable
database and folder structure.

Installation
------------
Download Visual Studio 2010 and compile it yourself. Or try to find a binary release.
